  Key Findings

  1. Counter-trend fade strategy fails in trending markets - Switching to trend-following
  improved consistency dramatically
  2. Balanced TP/SL (2.8x/0.4x) outperforms aggressive ratios - Higher win rate compensates
  for lower reward/risk
  3. Simpler is better - Disabling experimental filters improved results
  4. Market-condition dependent - Excels in volatile/trending periods, struggles in choppy
  markets
